# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# dragonhorde_frontend

The Dragon Horde is a website that allows users to collect various drakes and create an index of any they spot in the wild. Users will be able to create new cards with a dragon's name, species, picture and climate. They can like/unlike the cards as well as remove them from the list. When they add two of a kind, they'll receive a crown icon.

If time permits, I'd like to include a journal where users can include descriptions of sightings, potential spells to ward off attacks, and if they make three entries then they receive a laurel or wings.
