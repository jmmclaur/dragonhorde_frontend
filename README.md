# dragonhorde_frontend

The Dragon Horde is a website that allows users to collect various drakes and create an index of any they spot in the wild.

Users will be able to create new cards with a dragon's name, species, picture and diet. They can like/unlike the cards as well as remove them from the list. When they add two of a kind, they'll receive a crown icon.

If time permits, I'd like to include a journal where users can include descriptions of sightings, and if they make three entries then they receive a laurel or wings.
